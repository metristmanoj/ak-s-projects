<p style="font-size:150%">

We are a group of social minded people who are willing to organize
people who are willing to contribute to the welfare of the society.
Many people know that they can do but they don't know how to do it.
"common man can do"is a perfect platform for them to contribute
to the development of the society.There are few basic problems like
lackage of water,drainage problems in many people's area.we can
solve that together.Even many big problems can be solved by
organizing many awareness programs.Our major idea is to develop
it like a social media so that everyone can make use of it.</p>
