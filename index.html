	<div class="content">
	<p>The spontaneous uprising in Tamil Nadu, of students and youth to protect Tamil traditions and culture is laudable and admirable (“TN takes jallikattu issue to PM”, Jan.19). The distance they have maintained from political parties is sensible. As parents and teachers, we are proud of them for their focus, unity and dedication to achieve an objective. However, I wish that they look at other social issues as well. Water and air pollution, linking rivers, the need for better agricultural practices, creating employment avenues and better education are issues that have to be looked into considering that our leaders have promised solutions to them which are still elusive. Once young people make a breakthrough, changes are possible. There will be light at the end of the tunnel. Many of us hope for a new dawn.</p>

	<div class="aside">
	<p>The demand that jallikattu be restored is another example of the “post-truth” phenomenon wherein public opinion is significantly inspired by emotional appeals rather than influenced by rational rebuttals and factual representations.

		<h2 >SOCIAL AWARENESS MARATHON</h2>

	<div class="news">

	<div class="content">
	<p>Being a half marathoner myself I have never run an event for raising any awareness.
So here are r3 my thoughts on how a Marathon can raise awareness.
<br>1. The event itself is about awareness. There are Pinkathons to raise awareness on breast cancer, Run for Diabetes and more.
<br><br>2. People who participate carry boards or wear t-shirts for the cause they are running.
<br><br>3. Post pictures on social media about them running a marathon for a cause. </p>
